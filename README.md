# Question-Similarity-Suggestion-Tool
# Project Overview

The Question Similarity Suggestion Tool is a web application designed to suggest similar questions based on a user's input. The application leverages the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model to compute the similarity between the user's query and a set of pre-defined questions stored in a JSON file. The goal is to provide users with relevant suggestions that match their queries, enhancing their experience by offering useful and related information.

# Detailed Project Breakdown

## app.py
- **Purpose**: Contains the Flask application with routes for handling HTTP requests.
- **Goal**: Serve as the entry point for the web application, managing user requests and routing them to the appropriate service functions.
- **Advantage**: Centralizes route definitions and application logic, making it easier to manage and understand the application's flow. Helps in separating the web interface from the business logic.

## requirements.txt
- **Purpose**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
- **Goal**: Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and configured correctly in the virtual environment.
- **Advantage**: Simplifies setting up the development environment by providing a single file to install all dependencies, ensuring consistency across different setups.

## data/questions.json
- **Purpose**: Contains the dataset with questions used for similarity computation.
- **Goal**: Provide a structured data source in JSON format that can be easily read and processed.
- **Advantage**: JSON is a lightweight and easy-to-parse format, making it convenient for storing and retrieving structured data.

## models/question_model.py
- **Purpose**: Implements the logic for computing question similarity using the TF-IDF model.
- **Goal**: Define a class `QuestionModel` to handle text vectorization with TF-IDF and similarity calculations.
- **Advantage**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is effective for transforming text into numerical features that reflect word importance. It is simple to understand and implement, making it a good choice for baseline models in text similarity tasks.

## services/data_service.py
- **Purpose**: Contains logic for loading and preparing data from `questions.json`.
- **Goal**: Read and preprocess the data to be used by the model.
- **Advantage**: Separates data handling from the model logic, making it easier to modify or extend data processing without impacting the model. Enhances code readability and maintainability.

## services/model_service.py
- **Purpose**: Contains logic for initializing the model and computing similarities between questions.
- **Goal**: Use the `QuestionModel` class to perform similarity computations and provide recommendations.
- **Advantage**: Encapsulates the model-related functionality, making it easier to manage and extend. Provides a clear interface for interacting with the model and computing results.

## templates/index.html
- **Purpose**: HTML template for the web interface where users interact with the application.
- **Goal**: Provide a user-friendly interface for submitting queries and displaying results.
- **Advantage**: Separates the presentation layer from the application logic, allowing for easier modifications to the user interface without affecting the backend.

## static/css/styles.css
- **Purpose**: Contains CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the web interface.
- **Goal**: Style the HTML elements to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Advantage**: Allows for customization of the web interface's look and feel, improving user experience. Keeping styles in a separate file promotes modularity and ease of maintenance.

# Advantages of Using TF-IDF
- **Simplicity**: TF-IDF is straightforward to implement and understand. It transforms text into numerical vectors while reflecting the importance of terms within the document and corpus.
- **Effectiveness**: TF-IDF is effective for tasks like document similarity, search, and information retrieval. It captures the relevance of terms based on their frequency and inverse document frequency, making it suitable for text-based applications.
- **Low Computational Requirements**: Compared to more complex models like those based on deep learning, TF-IDF is less resource-intensive, making it appropriate for applications with limited computational resources or smaller datasets.
- **Baseline Model**: TF-IDF provides a solid baseline for text similarity tasks. It can be a starting point before exploring more advanced models like word embeddings or transformers. If TF-IDF performs well, it may be sufficient for the application’s needs.

# Summary
The purpose of the Question Similarity Suggestion Tool is to provide an easy-to-use web application that suggests similar questions based on user input, leveraging the simplicity and effectiveness of the TF-IDF model for text similarity tasks. The project structure is designed to be modular and maintainable, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enhancing both development and user experience.
